/**
 * Run the REAL bin under Node, optionally posing as oam by preloading a

 *
 * The unit tests above prove the decision; these prove the launcher WIRES it
 * -- that the call site actually reads `process.versions.oam` and the sandbox
 * grant list -- which no amount of testing `runtimePlan` in isolation can. A
 * real oam cannot be assumed on every box this suite runs on, and the preload
 * changes exactly the one fact the launcher branches on.
 *
 * OAM_BIN is pinned to the Node binary running this test, which makes the two
 * outcomes unmistakable without a real oam. In-process, `--version` reaches
 * dist/index.js and prints the package version with exit 0. On the discovery
 * path, the pinned Node answers `--version` with v22.x or later, which clears
 * the floor, so it is chosen and the launcher spawns `node [flags] run <entry>`
 * -- which has no `run` subcommand, prints no version and exits non-zero. A
 * usable OAM_BIN is taken before discovery runs, so a real oam on the
 * developer's box is never reached either.
 *
 * Env is a whitelist so a REDIS_MCP_* or REDIS_URL var exported by the
 * developer's shell cannot change what is being asserted.
