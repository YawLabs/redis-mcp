 * artifact whose failure mode (the guard reads false under an npm shim, and the
 * launcher silently does nothing) is worse than the gap this closes. This is

/**
 * Run the REAL bin under Node, optionally posing as oam by preloading a

 *
 * The unit tests above prove the decision; these prove the launcher WIRES it
 * -- that the call site actually reads `process.versions.oam` and the sandbox
 * grant list -- which no amount of testing `runtimePlan` in isolation can. A
 * real oam cannot be assumed on every box this suite runs on, and the preload
 * changes exactly the one fact the launcher branches on.
 *
 * OAM_BIN is pinned to the Node binary running this test, which makes the two
 * outcomes unmistakable without a real oam. In-process, `--version` reaches
 * dist/index.js and prints the package version with exit 0. On the discovery
 * path, findOam returns that pinned Node, `node --version` clears the floor,
 * and the launcher spawns `node [flags] run <entry>` -- which has no `run`
 * subcommand, prints no version and exits non-zero. It also keeps a real oam
 * installed on the developer's box out of reach, since findOam checks the
 * override first and never scans past it.
 *
 * Env is a whitelist so a REDIS_MCP_* or REDIS_URL var exported by the
 * developer's shell cannot change what is being asserted.
