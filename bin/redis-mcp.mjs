/**
 * Runtime launcher for @yawlabs/redis-mcp.
 *
 * Prefers the oam runtime (https://oamjs.org) and falls back to the Node
 * process already running this file.
 *
 *
 * WHY THE FALLBACK COSTS NOTHING
 * npm has already started Node to run this launcher, so falling back is a
 * plain `import()` of the server into THIS process: no extra spawn, no extra
 * startup, byte-identical to invoking dist/index.js directly. Discovery is
 * stat-only -- never a subprocess -- so the miss case stays sub-millisecond.
 *
 * WHAT THE OAM PATH COSTS
 * Reaching oam through an npm `bin` means Node boots first and oam boots
 * second, so the launcher is slower than either runtime alone. Measured on
 * npmjs-mcp (windows-arm64, n=12 medians, spawn to first MCP initialize):
 * oam 116ms, node 172ms, launcher 243ms. oam is the fastest runtime and the
 * launcher is the slowest path -- it exists for `npx` convenience.
 *
 * For an MCP host config, point straight at oam and skip this file:
 *   { "command": "oam", "args": ["run", "<abs>/dist/index.js"] }
 *
 * ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM
 * A host can resolve this package's `bin` and launch `oam run <this file>`
 * instead of `node <this file>` -- Yaw MCP does, and so does oam's sidecar
 * regression matrix. This launcher used to discover oam and spawn it anyway,
 * so one server cost two runtime boots: measured on Windows, oam.exe with a
 * NESTED oam.exe + conhost.exe underneath it. Now, when `process.versions.oam`
 * clears the same MINIMUM OAM VERSION a discovered binary has to, the server is
 * imported into THIS process exactly as the Node fallback is -- no discovery,
 * no `oam --version` probe, no second oam. OAM_BIN is a discovery input, so it
 * is not consulted on that path: the host has already chosen which oam runs.
 *
 * Two cases skip that shortcut and take the discovery path, deliberately.
 * REDIS_MCP_SANDBOX=1, because `--permission` is a process-level flag that only
 * a FRESH oam can apply -- serving in-process there would drop the sandbox, and
 * the REDIS_URL-pinned net grant with it, without a word: a security downgrade
 * dressed up as an optimisation. And a host oam below the floor, which takes
 * the discovery path exactly as it always did.
 *
 * The discovery path is not a guaranteed spawn. When it finds no usable oam --
 * none at all, one below the floor, or one that fails to launch --
 * REDIS_MCP_RUNTIME=auto falls back to running the server in-process, exactly
 * as it does on Node, and that fallback carries NO --permission: the sandbox is
 * not applied, silently when no oam was found or it failed to launch.
 * REDIS_MCP_RUNTIME=oam turns every one of those into a hard exit instead, so
 * set it alongside REDIS_MCP_SANDBOX=1 when an unsandboxed server is not
 * acceptable.
 *
 * THE `--permission` SANDBOX (oam 0.9.0+, opt-in)
 * `REDIS_MCP_SANDBOX=1` runs a spawned oam under its permission model. It
 * cannot sandbox a server that ends up in-process -- see the discovery-path
 * fallback under ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM.
 *
 * The net grant is DERIVED from REDIS_URL at launch, for the same reason as
 * postgres-mcp: the one endpoint it may reach is the one it was pointed at, with
 * host and port both pinned because grants are prefix-matched. Filesystem and
 * child-process stay denied.
 *
 * Opt-in, not default: a denied environment variable is ABSENT from process.env
 * rather than throwing, so an under-granted REDIS_URL reads as "not configured".
 * The env list is derived from the shipped bundle.
 *
 * MINIMUM OAM VERSION
 * 0.9.0. Below it `child_process.execFile` ran its arguments through a SHELL,
 * `exec` accepted `timeout` and ignored it, `spawnSync` truncated at
 * `maxBuffer` while reporting success, and `stdio: 'inherit'`/`'ignore'` both
 * behaved as `'pipe'`. This server spawns nothing, so the floor is
 * enforced for consistency across @yawlabs/*-mcp rather than because this
 * launcher was exposed.
 * An older oam is not an error: the launcher falls back to Node and says so on
 * stderr. Pinning the floor here is what makes that fallback automatic.
 *
 * SELECTION
 *   REDIS_MCP_RUNTIME=oam    require oam; fail loudly if it is missing
 *                            (already running on oam 0.9.0+ satisfies it,
 *                            except under REDIS_MCP_SANDBOX=1)
 *   REDIS_MCP_RUNTIME=node   never use oam
 *   REDIS_MCP_RUNTIME=auto   prefer oam, silently fall back (default)
 *   REDIS_MCP_SANDBOX=1      run a spawned oam under --permission (oam 0.9.0+);
 *                            NOT applied when auto falls back in-process
 *   OAM_BIN=/path/to/oam     explicit binary, checked before any discovery
