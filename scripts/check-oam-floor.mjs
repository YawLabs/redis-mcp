/**
 * Is the oam floor current, and does the whole repo agree on what it is?
 *
 * Ported from aws-mcp's scripts/check-oam-floor.mjs, with the launcher name, the
 * env var and the HISTORICAL / VERSION_RE rules adapted to this repo's prose.
 *
 * The policy is that this server is verified on ONE oam release at a time, and
 * `OAM_MIN` in bin/redis-mcp.mjs is what enforces it: the launcher refuses to serve
 * on anything older. Two things go wrong with that by hand, and both have (in
 * aws-mcp, where this checker comes from).
 *
 * DRIFT. The floor is quoted in prose and in test fixtures as well as in the
 * constant -- README's Runtime section, the two env-var rows, the launcher's own
 * floor assertion. A bump that misses one leaves the docs describing a floor the
 * code does not have. It has happened: aws-mcp's src/tools/script.ts once sat at
 * 0.9.0 while the constant said 0.15.2. This half needs no network and is checked on every
 * `npm test` through src/oam-floor.test.ts, which is what makes it gate a release
 * (release.sh runs the suite) without anyone remembering to run anything.
 *
 * STALENESS. oam keeps shipping. 0.16.3 was published two hours before the aws-mcp
 * 2.5.0 release that pinned it -- so "latest" moves faster than a release cycle, and the
 * floor is stale again the moment upstream publishes. This half needs the network,
 * so it lives here and runs from release.sh rather than from the unit suite.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-oam-floor.mjs              both checks
 *   node scripts/check-oam-floor.mjs --offline    drift only, no network
 *   node scripts/check-oam-floor.mjs --root DIR   check that tree (for tests)
 *
 * Exit 1 on drift, always -- an inconsistent repo is a bug with no upside.
 * Exit 1 when the floor is behind the latest release, UNLESS
 * REDIS_MCP_ALLOW_STALE_OAM=1, which is the deliberate, visible way to ship a
 * release anyway. Exit 0 when the network is unavailable: a checker that turns an
 * offline machine into a failed release would just get switched off.
